# Surface Area Calculator Using Camera

## Overview
This project uses a camera to calculate the surface area of specific objects. By analyzing the object through the camera, it computes the surface area of the cuboid that would enclose the object, providing accurate and real-time measurements.

## Features
- **Real-time Surface Area Calculation**: Capture the object using a camera, and the system calculates the surface area of the cuboid that encloses it.
- **Accurate & Efficient**: The algorithm ensures precise measurements for any object within the camera's frame.
- **Simple to Use**: Minimal steps needed to get the surface area measurements.

## How it Works
1. Point the camera at an object.
2. The system captures the object's dimensions.
3. It calculates and displays the surface area of the cuboid that would enclose the object.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for core logic and application development.
- **OpenCV** for camera interfacing and object detection.
